# VolumeHandControl

VolumeHandControl is a Python project that uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control the system volume. The project leverages the Mediapipe library for hand detection and gesture recognition, and the Pycaw library for controlling the system volume on Windows.

## Features

- Adjust system volume using hand gestures.
- Mute and unmute the system volume with a specific gesture.
- Real-time FPS display.
- Visual feedback with a volume bar.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Numpy
- Pycaw
- Comtypes

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VolumeHandControl.git
cd VolumeHandControl
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install the Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
opencv-python-headless
mediapipe
numpy
pycaw
comtypes
```

## Usage

Run the script:

```sh
python VolumeHandControl.py
```

## How It Works

- The script captures video from the webcam and uses Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks.
- The distance between the thumb and index finger tips is used to determine the volume level.
- A specific gesture (peace sign) is used to toggle mute and unmute.
- The current volume level is displayed with a volume bar on the screen.
- The FPS is also displayed on the screen for performance monitoring.

## Code Explanation

The script initializes the camera and sets up Mediapipe for hand tracking. It then enters a loop where it reads frames from the webcam, processes them to detect hand landmarks, and calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger to control the volume. The volume level is displayed as a bar on the screen, and the current FPS is shown in the top left corner.

### Key Components

- **Mediapipe**: For hand landmark detection.
- **Pycaw**: For controlling the system volume.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video and displaying the GUI.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Webcam not working**: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and not being used by another application.
- **Dependencies not installed**: Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Hand landmarks not detected**: Ensure your hand is within the camera frame and clearly visible.
